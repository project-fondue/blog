We've been hanging out in Paris for the weekend for a mini sprint/planning session. Naturally we made a point of getting out for Fondue which as always was pretty awesome.

One of the things we've been up to is spending some time bugfixing and putting out the v3.0 release of `CSS Sprite Generator`_ which Ed's been working on recently. Ed's added a feature for Vertical and Horizontal layout of sprites which has been requested a few times. Translations are now available via dedicated subdomains which is a distinct improvement. In addition a Russian Translation contributed by Pavel Sorokin and a Turkish Translation provided by Kerem Can Caliskan are now live.

The time in Paris gave us a time to finalise this blog and we've also planned out future changes to our architecture and systems which has been invaluable to help keep everything running smoothly whilst minimising all manual repetitive tasks to next to nothing.

We'll have plenty to talk about in the future; from the details on development of existing applications, as well as exciting things that are coming up. Most importantly for us is that this can be a two-way conversation and we look forward to hearing your thoughts, comments and suggestions on everything at Project Fondue.
